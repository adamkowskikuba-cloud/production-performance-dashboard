# 🏭 Production Performance Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard was created to monitor key production metrics:
- **Production Yield (%)**
- **Average Efficiency (kg/h)**
- **Downtime Ratio (%)**

It allows for analysis by **production line** and **product type**, with daily trends visualized for each metric.
